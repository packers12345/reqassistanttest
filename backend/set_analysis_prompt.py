**System Context:**
{context if context else "No additional context provided."}

**Requirements ({len(requirements)} total):**
{req_block}

**Extracted Glossary:**
{glossary_block}

**Already-Detected Issues (programmatic checks -- do NOT repeat these):**
{prog_block}

**Task:**
Assess this requirement set on five dimensions. For each, give an assessment (complete, partial, poor), a confidence score (0-1), specific findings, and actionable recommendations.

1. **C10 - Coverage**: Are there obvious missing requirements for the stated system context? Are failure modes, edge cases, or operational scenarios unaddressed?
2. **C11 - Logical Consistency**: Do any requirements contradict each other semantically (beyond the numeric/terminology conflicts already detected above)?
3. **C12 - Feasibility**: Can the full set of requirements be satisfied simultaneously? Are there implicit resource or physics constraints that make the set infeasible?
4. **C13 - Organization**: Is the set well-structured? Are requirements at a consistent level of abstraction? Is there unnecessary overlap?
5. **C14 - Validation Strategy**: Can this set be validated end-to-end? Are acceptance criteria clear enough to design a test plan?

**Output Format (JSON only, no other text):**
